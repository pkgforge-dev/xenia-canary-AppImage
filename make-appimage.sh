# ADD LIBRARIES
quick-sharun ./build/bin/Linux/Release/xenia_canary

# Additional changes can be done in between here

# Turn AppDir into AppImage
quick-sharun --make-appimage

# Test the app for 12 seconds, if the app normally quits before that time
# then skip this or check if some flag can be passed that makes it stay open
# quick-sharun --test ./dist/*.AppImage

# test is disable because the application is not able to run in docker at all!
